# CV-Project | Power Loss Estimation for Photovoltaic Modules

Computer Vision Project for Solar Pannels

## Introduction

 Solar photovoltaic (PV) modules play a crucial role in renewable energy systems. However, their efficiency can be compromised by environmental factors such as dust and dirt accumulation. This project aims to develop an AI model for predicting power loss in PV modules due to soiling.

This project **aims to achieve three** main **goals**:

Develop an AI model that predicts the power loss of a PV module.
 - Use data augmentation techniques to improve the accuracy of the model.
 - Develop a CV pipeline to automatically segment the soiling of PV modules.
 - The project will also evaluate the performance of the AI model and CV pipeline using a variety of metrics.

### Part I

Part I is composed by the file **Preprocessing + EDA**.

On this file, we apply some preprocessing techniques to the dataset like:
1) Breaking down the string that identifies the images in attributes/ columns composed by the following attributes
2) Month, day, hour, minute, seconds 
3) Mapping the month to numbers 
4) Datatype conversions 
5) Timestamp ordering and index resetting 
6) Visualizations 
7) Dimensionality Reduction 
8) Creation of a new folder with roughly 1/4 of the original data


### Part2

 - Pipeline Implementation with Pytorch
 - Dataset Class to match the labels with the image
 - Data Augmentation 
 - Visualizations
 - NN Architecture
 - Training Testing
 - Explainability

### Part 3 Pipeline
