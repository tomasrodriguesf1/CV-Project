Computer Vision Project for Solar Pannels

### Part I

Part I is composed by the file **Preprocessing + EDA**.

On this file, we apply some preprocessing techniques to the dataset like:
1) Breaking down the string that identifies the images in attributes/ columns composed by the following attributes
2) Month, day, hour, minute, seconds 
3) Mapping the month to numbers 
4) Datatype conversions 
5) Timestamp ordering and index resetting 
6) Visualizations 
7) Dimensionality Reduction 
8) Creation of a new folder with roughly 1/4 of the original data


### Part2

 - Pipeline Implementation with Pytorch
 - Dataset Class to match the labels with the image
 - Data Augmentation 
 - Visualizations
 - NN Architecture
 - Training Testing
 - Explainability

### Part 3 Pipeline
